    "details": "Developed a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model supporting 20+ business constraints to optimize annual promotion planning for all devices, achieving around $3M cost savings in the first year. Designed and implemented N-BEATS time series models to forecast sales for new device launches, solving cold-start issues by leveraging related signals and historical launches. Owned end-to-end pipelines on AWS (EMR, S3, Lambda, etc.), making these models production-ready and monitored."

Prototyped LLM-driven personalization flows with retrieval over product and behavioral data, comparing MCP vs. RAG orchestrations, and focused on guardrails for factuality, latency, and cost."
